This is a simple onboarding platform built with Next.js and MongoDB. It was developed as part of a technical assessment to demonstrate how I handle full-stack development using modern tools.

## What This Project Does

- Collects user details step-by-step
- Saves user data in a MongoDB database
- Lets admins view submitted users from a dashboard
- Validates email before submission
- Fully responsive layout (mobile and desktop)

## Tools I Used

- **Next.js (App Router)** for routing and backend API
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **MongoDB** for database
- **ShadCN UI** for prebuilt components
